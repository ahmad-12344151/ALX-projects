It provides high-performance, multidimensional array objects, numerical computing tools, and is fundamental in scientific computing. It is the core library for scientific computing in Python ([see the full documentation](https://numpy.org/)).\n","\n","### What is an array?\n","An array in the context of NumPy, a widely-used Python library, is a fundamental data structure designed for efficient storage and manipulation of numerical data. Although it shares some similarities with Python lists, there are key differences that make NumPy arrays more suitable for data analysis and scientific computing. Some of these key differences are:\n","- Lists can contain heterogeneous data types (combinations of `str`, `int`, even `list`), whilst NumPy arrays can only store values of the same data type. This restriction allows NumPy to optimise storage and computation, as operations on homogeneously-typed elements are more efficient.\n","- NumPy arrays can be thought of as a grid of values and can be multi-dimensional. This multidimensional nature makes them extremely versatile for a wide range of applications, from simple lists of values (1D) to images (2D) or even higher-dimensional data.\n","- NumPy arrays are stored more efficiently than Python lists. Lists in Python are essentially arrays of pointers to objects, with each pointer also requiring additional space. In contrast, NumPy arrays directly store data in adjacent blocks of memory. This compact and continuous storage reduces the memory footprint and improves cache utilisation, which is critical for performance in large-scale computations.\n","- One of the most powerful features of NumPy arrays is their support for vectorised operations. This means that operations on arrays, such as addition, multiplication, and complex mathematical functions, can be performed on all elements of the array simultaneously. This is not only more syntactically convenient but also significantly faster than looping over elements, as is common with Python lists.\n","\n","\n","### Creating a NumPy array\n","If we want to work with any NumPy objects or functions we first need to import the NumPy library.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true},"id":"azeLN4HQ1LJo"},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GAPhCHRj1LJo"},"source":["### Example 1\n","\n","To create a NumPy array, we use the `np.array()` function.
